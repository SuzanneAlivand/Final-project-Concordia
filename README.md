# MyCatLog 😺🎮

### Final-project of Concordia's full-stack web development bootcamp

This is a full-stack project using **MERN**. Pure CSS is used for styling.
An external API called [RAWG](https://rawg.io/apidocs) is used to fetch the required data.
For authentication purposes, I've used [Auth0](https://auth0.com/). I deployed this project on [heroku](heroku.com) using its free-tier hosting service. I have also used [freenom](https://www.freenom.com/en/index.html?lang=en) to register mycatlog.tk domain.

## Config ⚙️

You are going to need an API key from **rawg.io** in order to run this project. I've also used **Auth0** for authentication so you need to have acquired an Auth0 domain and client key. You also need to connect a **mongoDB** to this project.
