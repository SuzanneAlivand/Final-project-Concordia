### Final-project Concordia's full-stack web development bootcamp
This is a full-stack project using MERN. Pure CSS is used for styling. 
An external API called [RAWG](https://rawg.io/apidocs) is used to fetch the required data. 
For authentication purposes, I've used [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).

3. completed and 
4. abandoned.
